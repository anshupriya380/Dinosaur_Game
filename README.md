The dinosaur game, often referred to as the "Chrome Dinosaur Game" or "T-Rex Runner," is a popular web-based endless runner game that can be played in the Google Chrome browser. It is a simple yet addictive game that is accessible to users when they lose internet connectivity and encounter the offline "No Internet" error page in Chrome.
In this game, players take control of a cute pixelated T-Rex dinosaur character, and their objective is to run as far as possible while avoiding various obstacles that appear on the screen. The game gradually increases in speed, making it more challenging as players progress. The controls are straightforward: press the spacebar or tap the screen on mobile devices to make the dinosaur jump and avoid obstacles like cacti and flying pterodactyls.
